% TIME for q1a

?- Start is cputime, solve_and_print, End is cputime, Time is End - Start.

Start = 35.89
End = 39.921
Time = 4.0309999999999988


% SOLUTION for q1a

The value of J is: 3
The value of E is: 0
The value of T is: 8
The value of A is: 1
The value of X is: 5
The value of L is: 4
The value of O is: 6
The value of V is: 2

% TIME for q1b

% ?- Start is cputime, solve_and_print, End is cputime, Time is End - Start.

Start = 74.406
End = 74.406
Time = 0.0


% SOLUTION for q1b

The value of J is: 3
The value of E is: 0
The value of T is: 8
The value of A is: 1
The value of X is: 5
The value of L is: 4
The value of O is: 6
The value of V is: 2


% the time for q1b is much quicker than q1a because it has to do much less backtracking as it can generate and test as it goes
