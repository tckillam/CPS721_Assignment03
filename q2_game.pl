%%%%% SECTION: fourExactly
%%%%% Below, you should define rules for the predicate "fourExactly(X,List)", 
%%%%% which takes in an input List and checks whether there are exactly 4 
%%%%% occurrences of a given element X in the list.
%%%%%
%%%%% If you introduce any other helper predicates for implementing fourExactly,
%%%%% they should be included in this section.

fourExactly(X,List) :- counter(X,List,0,Amount), Amount = 4.

counter(X,[X],Total,Amount) :- Amount is Total + 1.
counter(X,[H],Total,Amount) :- not X=H, Amount is Total.
counter(X,[X|T],Total,Amount) :- X=X, NewTotal is Total + 1, counter(X,T,NewTotal,Amount).
counter(X,[H|T],Total,Amount) :- not X=H, counter(X,T,Total,Amount).

%%%%% SECTION: gameSolve
%%%%% Below, you should define rules for the predicate "solve", which takes in your list of
%%%%% variables and finds an assignment for each variable which solves the problem.
%%%%%
%%%%% You should also define rules for the predicate "solve_and_print" which calls your
%%%%% solve predicate and prints out the results in an easy to read, human readable format.
%%%%% The predicate "solve_and_print" should take in no arguments
%%%%%
%%%%% This section should also include your domain definitions and any other helper
%%%%% predicates (other than fourExactly and its helpers) that you choose to introduce.
