/**
When choosing which constraints to implement when, we would first see which ones required the least amount of variables. 
We woud then generate values for those variables and then test them against the constraints. When implementing the more
complicated constraints, we would choose them based on the variables that have already been generated. For example, we 
implemented constraint 5 pretty quickly once we generated values for all the weights, we could test them against the 
fertilizers since you needed both to solve constraint 5

% TIME for q3

?- Start is cputime, solve_and_print, End is cputime, Time is End - Start.

Start = 0.312
End = 0.312
Time = 0.0


% SOLUTION for q3

The cputime is: 0.0.

The output reads as -->
Plant: [Fertilizer, Height, Yield, Weight]

P1: [bone-meal, 2, 12, 3]
