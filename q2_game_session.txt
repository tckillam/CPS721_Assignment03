Scarborough: [w, n, l, d, d]
Toronto: [l, w, n, d, d]

% we would first find the simplest constraints and the variables needed for them, we would then generate
% the values for those variables and then test them against those constraints, as the constraints got more
% complicated, we would slowly generate more variables and implement those constraints
